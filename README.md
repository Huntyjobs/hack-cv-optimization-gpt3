This repo contains the code of the backend service that powers our app https://cvoptimization-dev.hunty.cloud/. The FE was build on React and belongs to a microfrontends ecosystem that is private to our company. However the interesting part of the whole product can be found here, as follows.

Our service connects the FE with the APIs of Google Document AI to process initial resume file and OpenAI newest chatGPT API to perform conversation such that the desired tailored CV results as output at the moment the user considers appropiate.
